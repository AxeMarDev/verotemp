# What is Verotemp?

Verotemp is a quick templating system for generating repetative documents. An example usecase is generating 100 party invitaions from a csv file of guest. This project was originally developed in a previous position i held at my parent's electrial contracting practice. The repository was stored locally, so i will rebuild the webapp for the enjoyment of whoever comes accross this project. 
In addition to bulk document generation, the web app performs the following functions. 
- Maintaining client list
- Maintaining Document list
- storing documents in the cloud
- Relationship mapping between clients and documents

This repository will hold the front end code.
